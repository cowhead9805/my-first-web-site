      Your mindset is a set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the
      world and yourself. It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any
      given situation. It means that what you believe about yourself impacts
      your success or failure. According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck,
      your beliefs play a pivotal role in what you want and whether you achieve
      it.1 Dweck has found that it is your mindset that plays a significant role
      in determining achievement and success. Mindsets can influence how people
      behave in a wide range of situations in life. For example, as people
      encounter different situations, their mind triggers a specific mindset
      that then directly impacts their behavior in that situation.
