    <h2>Make a system</h2>
    <p>
      A system is an organized collection of subsystems needed to attain a
      specific goal. Many different inputs maketh a system which will help
      deliver the desired outcomes. Usually a system is made up of smaller
      subsystems. If one smaller sub system fails, the entire system fails to
      operate. The systems might vary from simple to complex, and there are
      numerous types of systems available in the market. Each system has its own
      processes, methods, inputs and outcomes. The nature of the system is
      systematic and if any part or activities in the system is misaligned, it
      would cause problems to the entire system as a whole.
