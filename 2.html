    <h2>Don't kill your time</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re okay with killing time, it’s not scarce enough. Time is scarce,
      life is short, and as the grains of sand slip through the hourglass, so
      does the precious gift of time. Once gone, it disappears forever. We all
      know these things. And yet, at work and at home, we’re so lost in a trance
      of distraction that killing time has become a chronic disease. I remember
      the moment I started thinking about this. It was 2017, I was living in New
      York, and if I didn’t find a roommate, I’d go broke. I was paying for two
      rooms in my apartment, and my name was on the lease. None of my friends
      wanted the spare room, so I posted an ad on Craigslist. Two hours later, I
      received a reply from a 31-year-old PhD candidate named Mark. My roommate
      and I invited him to tour the apartment, and since he seemed like a nice
      guy, we invited him to live with us.
